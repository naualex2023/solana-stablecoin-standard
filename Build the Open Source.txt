Build the Open-Source SDK & Core Standards for Stablecoins on Solana

About
Superteam Brazil is building open-source standards for Solana — production-ready templates that institutions and builders can fork, customize, and deploy. We've shipped the Solana Vault Standard (SVS), and now we're tackling stablecoins.

This bounty creates the Solana Stablecoin Standard — a modular SDK with opinionated presets covering the most common stablecoin architectures.

Repository: github.com/solanabr/solana-stablecoin-standard

Reference for Quality & Structure: Solana Vault Standard — follow this repo's patterns for code organization, documentation, and SDK design.

Overview
Build a modular stablecoin SDK with standardized presets for Solana. The SDK is the core deliverable — a configurable toolkit where issuers choose which Token-2022 extensions and compliance modules to enable. The standards (SSS-1, SSS-2) are opinionated presets within the SDK.

Think OpenZeppelin: the library is the SDK, the contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721) are the standards. The library makes them easy to deploy, the standards are what get adopted.

Architecture
Three layers:

Layer 1 — Base SDK: Token creation with mint authority + freeze authority + metadata. Issuers choose which extensions to enable. Role management program. CLI + Typescript) SDK.

Layer 2 — Modules: Composable pieces that add capabilities. Compliance module (transfer hook, blacklist PDAs, permanent delegate). Privacy module (confidential transfers, allowlists). Each module is independently testable and optional.

Layer 3 — Standard Presets: Opinionated combinations of Layer 1 + Layer 2. These are the "standards" — what gets documented, recommended, and referenced.

 
Standard - SSS-1
Name - Minimal Stablecoin
What It Is - Mint authority + freeze authority + metadata. What's needed on every stable, nothing more.


Standard - SSS-2
Name - Compliant Stablecoin
What It Is - SSS-1 + permanent delegate + transfer hook + blacklist enforcement


SSS-1 is for simple stablecoins — internal tokens, DAO treasuries, ecosystem settlement. Compliance is reactive (freeze accounts as needed).

SSS-2 is for regulated stablecoins — USDC/USDT-class tokens where regulators expect on-chain blacklist enforcement and token seizure capabilities. Permanent delegate is needed here, and transfer hook checks every transfer against the blacklist — no gaps.

On-Chain Program (Anchor)
A single configurable program that supports both presets via initialization parameters, as exemplified here:

pub struct StablecoinConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub symbol: String,
    pub uri: String,
    pub decimals: u8,
    // SSS-2 compliance
    pub enable_permanent_delegate: bool,
    pub enable_transfer_hook: bool,
    pub default_account_frozen: bool,
}
Core instructions (all presets): initialize, mint, burn, freeze_account, thaw_account, pause, unpause, update_minter, update_roles, transfer_authority

SSS-2 additional: add_to_blacklist, remove_from_blacklist, seize (via permanent delegate). Plus a separate transfer hook program that enforces blacklist checks on every transfer.

Role-based access control: Master authority, minter (with per-minter quotas), burner, blacklister (SSS-2), pauser, seizer (SSS-2). No single key controls everything.

SSS-2 instructions must fail gracefully if the compliance module wasn't enabled during initialization.

Backend Services
Core (all presets):

Mint/burn service — Fiat-to-stablecoin lifecycle coordination (request → verify → execute → log)

Event listener/indexer — Monitor on-chain events, maintain off-chain state, webhook notifications

SSS-2 additional:

Compliance service — Blacklist management, sanctions screening integration point, transaction monitoring, audit trail export

Webhook service — Configurable event notifications with retry logic

Rust or TypeScript, Docker containerized, environment-based config, structured logging, health checks.

Admin CLI
This is critical — operators need to execute actions fast.

# SDK approach: choose your standard
sss-token init --preset sss-1
sss-token init --preset sss-2
sss-token init --custom config.toml

# Operations
sss-token mint <recipient> <amount>
sss-token burn <amount>
sss-token freeze <address>
sss-token thaw <address>
sss-token pause / unpause
sss-token status / supply

# SSS-2 compliance
sss-token blacklist add <address> --reason "OFAC match"
sss-token blacklist remove <address>
sss-token seize <address> --to <treasury>

# Management
sss-token minters list / add / remove
sss-token holders [--min-balance <amount>]
sss-token audit-log [--action <type>]
The sss-token init command is central — it supports preset modes and fully custom configurations via TOML/JSON config files.

TypeScript SDK
import { SolanaStablecoin, Presets } from "@stbr/sss-token";

// Preset initialization
const stable = await SolanaStablecoin.create(connection, {
  preset: Presets.SSS_2,
  name: "My Stablecoin",
  symbol: "MYUSD",
  decimals: 6,
  authority: adminKeypair,
});

// Or custom config
const custom = await SolanaStablecoin.create(connection, {
  name: "Custom Stable",
  symbol: "CUSD",
  extensions: { permanentDelegate: true, transferHook: false },
});

// Operations
await stable.mint({ recipient, amount: 1_000_000, minter });
await stable.compliance.blacklistAdd(address, "Sanctions match"); // SSS-2
await stable.compliance.seize(frozenAccount, treasury);           // SSS-2
const supply = await stable.getTotalSupply();

Tests
Unit tests for all instructions and SDK functions. Integration tests per preset (SSS-1: mint → transfer → freeze; SSS-2: mint → transfer → blacklist → seize). Fuzz tests via Trident. Preset config tests. Stress-tested Devnet deployment with example operations.

Bonus Features
SSS-3 Private Stablecoin — Confidential transfers + scoped allowlists. Experimental — tooling is still maturing. Document as proof-of-concept.

Oracle Integration Module — Switchboard oracle feeds for non-USD pegs (EUR, BRL, CPI-indexed). The token is pure SSS-1/SSS-2, the oracle is a separate program for mint/redeem pricing.

Interactive Admin TUI — Terminal UI for real-time monitoring and operations.

Example Frontend — Simple UI using the TypeScript SDK for stablecoin creation and management.

Submission Requirements
Submit PRs to github.com/solanabr/solana-stablecoin-standard.

A single PR with the full SDK + SSS-1 + SSS-2 is fine. Prize based on total value contributed.

Each PR must include:

All source code

Working tests

Devnet deployment proof (Program ID + example transactions)

Documentation

Docker setup for backend (docker compose up)

Iterate on feedback — PRs that evolve score higher.
